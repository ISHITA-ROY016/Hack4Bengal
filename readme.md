# DESPITE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENROLMENT RATES, THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IN BENGAL IS STILL A CAUSE OF CONCERN. LACK OF ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION, TEACHER SHORTAGES, AND INADEQUATE LEARNING RESOURCES ARE SOME OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY STUDENTS IN BENGAL STRUGGLE TO COMPETE WITH THEIR PEERS FROM OTHER PARTS OF INDIA. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF EDUCATION IN BENGAL.
